# Signup & Login Form using LocalStorage (HTML, CSS, JS)

This project is a simple **signup and login system** built using only **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with data stored in the browser using **localStorage**. 
It's ideal for beginners to understand how to handle form validation and simulate basic authentication without a backend.

## 🚀 Features

- Signup form with:
  - Full name validation
  - Email format validation
  - Strong password check (uppercase, lowercase, digit, special character)
- Login form with:
  - Stored credentials check using localStorage
  - Instant feedback on missing/invalid inputs
- All data stored securely in browser `localStorage`
- Clean UI using only HTML and CSS (no external libraries)

## 🧠 What I Learned

- DOM manipulation with JavaScript
- Custom form validations
- How `localStorage.setItem()`, `getItem()` and form events work
- How to build interactive UI without any backend

## 💻 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Browser Local Storage


## 📌 How It Works

1. User signs up with name, email, and password.
2. Data is stored in localStorage .
3. On login, inputs are matched with localStorage values.
4. Shows success or error messages based on match.
